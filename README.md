<h1>Lost Countdown Timer Web Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This web application is inspired by the countdown timer from the TV series Lost. The main goal is to create an engaging countdown experience with a twist.

<p>When the countdown reaches 5 minutes, the display starts showing both minutes and seconds, adding a sense of urgency. If the countdown hits zero without being reset, the display begins to randomize numbers, simulating the "failure" of the countdown.

<p>This project incorporates various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, along with MongoDB to track user rankings based on their interactions with the timer. Sounds and visual cues are also integrated to further enhance the immersive experience.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<li>Flip Clock Countdown: Displays a countdown that mirrors the Lost timer.</li>

<li>Interactive Input: Below 5 minutes, a code input field is enabled for users to interact with the countdown.</li>

<li>Sound Effects: Alerts and alarms start playing at key intervals.</li>

<li>Randomization at Zero: Once the countdown reaches zero, the timer begins to randomize, simulating an error.</li>

<li>Ranking System: Tracks and displays user rankings based on their successful inputs.</li>

<li>MongoDB Integration: Used for storing and retrieving ranking data.</li>

<li>Node.js Backend: Handles real-time countdown updates and user interaction using WebSockets.</li>
